This directory contains JSON dataset split files of the CFQ dataset, used in the generation of our classification datasets. Note that these files have more numbers of dev and test examples than the ones provided in the original CFQ dataset.
- `mcd.json` = `adequacy_split_s0.4x0.2x0.2_d1_6_0.json` (adhering to the notation in `all_divergence_splits` of CFQ)
- `random.json`: A randomly chosen split with same number of examples as in `mcd.json`
